    "Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\n",
    "It is used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - web development (server-side),\n",
    "  - software development,\n",
    "  - mathematics,\n",
    "  - system scripting.\n",

    "    ## What can Python do?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Python can be used on a server to create web applications.\n",
    "   - Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.\n",
    "   - Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\n",
    "   - Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n",
    "   - Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "   - Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "   - Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "   - Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "   - Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.\n"
